1ï¼‰assume that the quantomatics repo and the psgraph are cloned in the same folder, for example,
 
   $SOME_PATH/tinker 

we can check the readme file to make sure the path is correct, e.g. the readme for quantomatoics repo will be

   $SOME_PATH/tinker/quantomatic/README

similarly, the readme for the psgtarph repo will be 

   $SOME_PATH/tinker/psgraph/Readme

Note that both repo need to be latest version.

2) go to the tinker folder by

	cd $SOME_PATH/tinker 

 then to make the psgraph db, using 

	pp_make_database -p zed psgraph

3) then to open the psgraph db in the same directory, i.e.

 	xpp -d psgraph

4) in the cpp, to open the install file in

	$SOME_PATH/tinker/psgraph/src/core/provers/proofpower/build/install.ML

then to run this run to compile the required library into the psgraph db. 

5) now the psgraph db should be ok to load psgraph and run and run some experiments, no need to do steps 1 - 4 from this point.

6) to run some examples, open the psgraph db under
	$SOME_PATH/tinker 
by
	xpp -d psgraph

then open the following demo file in the pp to see if the tool can run correctly
	$SOME_PATH/tinker /psgraph/src/core/demo/AdvisoryBoardMeeting2015/tinker_proofpower


The line 
	PPIntf.set_psg_goal
is to ask pp to connect gui for proofs. Note that to enable gui to accept the connection from pp.
