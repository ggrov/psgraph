text{* 

 Firstly, we define a type type synonym for the state of the free store
 at level 1 to be a map from locations to sizes:
*}

type_synonym F1 = "Loc \<rightharpoonup> nat"

subsubsection{* Auxillary functions \label{s:isa:models:level1:aux} *}

text{*
Note that the size is only @{type nat} here so, as mentioned earlier, we must extend the 
@{const nat1} predicate to operate on maps and sets to ensure that the model is consistent
with VDM:
*}

definition 
  nat1_map :: "F1 \<Rightarrow> bool"
where
  "nat1_map f \<equiv> (\<forall> x. x \<in> dom f \<longrightarrow> nat1 (the (f x)))"

definition
  nat1_set :: "(nat set) \<Rightarrow> bool"
where
  "nat1_set S \<equiv> (\<forall> x. x \<in> S \<longrightarrow> nat1 x)"

text{* 
The level 1 model introduces a new auxiliary function, \emph{locs}
that returns the set of all free locations withing a given map. We define the \emph{locs} 
function using a union over the elements in the domain of the VDM map. 
It is wrapped inside a conditional expression, however,
in order to ensure that the map is appropriately a @{text nat1_map}:
*}

definition 
  locs :: "(Loc \<rightharpoonup> nat) \<Rightarrow> Loc set "
where
  "locs sm \<equiv> (if nat1_map sm then 
                \<Union> s \<in> dom sm. locs_of s (the (sm s)) 
               else 
                 undefined)" (* TODO: or {}?*)

text{* 
  It is otherwise @{term undefined}, which is a polymorphic constant in Isabelle.
  That is, the VDM model uses a total map to @{text "\<nat>\<^sub>1"}, whereas here we can only
  use a map to @{text "\<nat>"} as a parameter. Thus, we totalise the definition of @{term locs}
  by giving it a bottom element (as Isabelle's @{term undefined}) when the expected type fails. 
  
  It is important to emphasise this is not VDM's notion of undefinedness. For instance, it is
  possible to prove that @{lemma "undefined=undefined" by simp} in Isabelle, which is not true 
  in VDM's three-valued logic. Thus, @{term undefined} should never feature in our proofs. If it
  does, it means we made some mistake somewhere by applying a function to the wrong type. For 
  further discussion on the subtleties of handling partial functions, see 
 \cite{Jones95e,SchmalzPhD}.

subsubsection{* Invariant *}
text{*
\noindent Recall the level 1 invariant in Section~\ref{S-model-pp-l1}:


\begin{vdm}
\rtype{Free1}{\mapof{Loc}{\Nati}}{
      (f) \DeF \\
\forall*{l, l' \in \dom{f}}{l \neq l' \Implies is-disj(locs-of(l, f(l)), locs-of(l', f(l'))) \And} \\
\forall{l \in \dom{f}}{(l + f(l) ) \notin \dom{f}}
}
\end{vdm}

It contains two components (a conjunction):
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Disjoint}: that the locations defined by each element in the 
map are disjoint;
\item and, \emph{sep}: that the locations defined by elements do not
abut on any end.
\end{itemize}

\noindent We encode these as individual definitions in Isabelle: *}
(*<*)
definition
  Locs_of :: "F1 \<Rightarrow> Loc \<Rightarrow> (Loc set)"
where
  "Locs_of f l \<equiv> (if (l \<in> dom f) then 
                    locs_of l (the (f l))
                  else
                    undefined)"  (* TODO: or {}? *)

definition 
  disjoint :: "'a set \<Rightarrow> 'a set \<Rightarrow> bool"
where
 "disjoint A B \<equiv> A \<inter> B = {}"
(*>*)

definition 
  Disjoint :: "F1 \<Rightarrow> bool"
where
 "Disjoint f \<equiv> 
      (\<forall> a \<in> dom f. \<forall> b \<in> dom f . a \<noteq> b \<longrightarrow> disjoint (Locs_of f a) (Locs_of f b))"

definition 
  sep :: "F1 \<Rightarrow> bool" 
where
  "sep f \<equiv> (\<forall> l \<in> dom f . l + the(f l) \<notin> dom f)"

text{*
\noindent where @{term "disjoint A B"} is the same as @{term "A \<inter> B = \<emptyset>"}, and 
@{term "Locs_of f a"} is the same as @{term "locs_of a (the(f a))"}.

Albeit trivial, this decomposition into separate concepts is invaluable in taming
the goal complexity during proofs (see discussion in Section~\ref{S-TP-exp}). They
create what we call ``zoom'' levels of interest/discourse. For instance, we create
various lemmas about these definitions and their relationship with, say @{term locs_of}
and @{term locs} or set theory and map operators. So, in actual POs, these issues
of mechanisation are already distilled and resolved.  

We must also, however, have additional components to the invariant.
They are the implicit VDM notion of finiteness of maps and sets, and the
subtype checking on map range type for @{text "\<nat>\<^sub>1"}.

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{nat1\_map}: that the state doesn't contain any 
locations that map to size 0.
\item \emph{finite domain}: that the domain of the map is finite, similarly to level 0 state.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Thus, the invariant definition is as follows:
 *}

definition 
  F1_inv :: "F1 \<Rightarrow> bool" 
where
(*<*)  [intro!]:  (*>*) "F1_inv f \<equiv> Disjoint f \<and> sep f \<and> nat1_map f \<and> finite(dom f)"

definition 
  VDM_F1_inv :: "F1 \<Rightarrow> bool" 
where
  "VDM_F1_inv f \<equiv> Disjoint f \<and> sep f "
 
text{*
\noindent We also define the VDM invariant, as we may wish to discharge the
Isabelle parts the invariant first (finiteness etc), as they are often
simpler. We provide a lemma to `shape' the goal as such:

%\plannote{LF: IJW, didn't follow underline above. Isn't it the other way roung? I.e. VDM_F1_inv 
%is harder to prove than the other trivial bits?}
%IJW: I've reworded this. I agree: I was trying to say the conditions that arise from the translation
%is simpler.

\noindent Such proof decomposition is again essential for automation and proof strategy reuse,
as it informs (meta-)data collection (see Chapter~\ref{C-why} on meta-data and 
Chapter~\ref{C-isaproofs} on Isabelle proofs).

Furthermore, we define introduction and elimination rules
to help unfold the invariant; we also provide weakening rules

for set minimal and summation, respectively.

text{*
Once again, we used Isabelle's @{term undefined} to enable a total function over a subtype,
as we did for @{term locs}.

We have two versions of the postconditions: the exact translation from 
the VDM specification and a version where \emph{above}, \emph{below}, and \emph{ext}
are given as definitions. The latter definition makes proof more straightforward
since we can refer to the maps by name and unfold where necessary. We do, of course,
prove both definitions equivalent. This is another example of zooming:~the use of
different levels of interest in involved operators, that is based on the problem at hand,
and is useful in helping proof decomposition and lemma discovery for higher automation.

(*
text{* 
As explained in Section~\ref{S-TP-exp}, we modelled $DISPOSE1$ postcondition in various ways.
When we came to the Isabelle representation we encountered a few problems because of the VDM
model use of map comprehension for the definition of $DISPOSE1$. In Isabelle, map comprehension
isn't directly available. Thus, to model @{text below} as in the VDM

\begin{vdm} 
\begin{formula}
    below= \map{ l \mapsto f(l) | l \in \dom{f} \And l + ~{f}(l) = d}  
\end{formula}
\end{vdm}

\noindent we would need map comprehension in Isabelle. At first we tried something like this

@{term "map_of [ (x, the(f x)) . x \<leftarrow> sorted_list_of_set (dom f), l + (the(fhook x)) = d]"}

Although it does represent the map comprehension we need, it is rather protracted, 
unecessarily complates proof, as well as automation. That is because of the many type jumps
between generator as a set (@{term "dom f"}) that gets transformed into a list for the list
comprehension term that is given to a recursive function (@{term "map_of"}), which translates
a given list to an Isabelle map. 

This\footnote{And also discussion/suggestions within/from the Isabelle users mailing list} led
us to rethink the definition using available operators and avoiding map comprehension leading to
the current VDM as 

\begin{vdm} 
\begin{formula}
    below= \set{ l | l \in \dom{f} \And l + ~{f}(l) = d} \dsub f  
\end{formula}
\end{vdm}

\noindent It avoid map comprehension and uses domain filtering (or restriction), 
which was easier to encode in Isabelle as: 
*}     
*)
text{*
In our alternative formulation, the three existential variables are given as definitions, for example:
*}
definition 
  dispose1_below :: "F1 \<Rightarrow> Loc \<Rightarrow> F1"
where
  "dispose1_below f d \<equiv>  { x \<in> dom f . x + the(f x) = d } \<triangleleft> f" 

text{*
 \noindent These encoding considerations are crucial to ensure proofs are not complicated by
 technicalities unrelated to the problem. One must not, however, fall for the temptation to 
 chisel the model into whatever the theorem prover would be happier with. Our modification 
 is clearly equivalent, and can be proved as such if that's the case, we we have done for the
 layered definition of dispose with respect to the original one.

% \plannote{LF: Should we prove the map comprehension version equals the one with domain restriction?}

subsection{* Summary \label{s:isa:models:summary} *}

text{*
The translation from VDM to Isabelle is relatively straightforward and faithful to the 
original model. Operations in VDM have a fairly natural translation to Isabelle's locale
module system, where definitions can be used for the post-condition. It is future work to build
a VDM package on top of Isabelle that would enable a syntactic emulation of VDM operations, thus
reducing the chance of a human error in the translation (we, for example, forgot the invariant 
on our first iteration). 
%
While our strategy of packaging up preconditions, postconditions, and the invariants in 
definitions makes for additional proof steps, it ensures a comparmentalised proof and constructs
explicit `zoom' levels to have a clear domain of discourse.
%
Additionally, our naming scheme makes it relatively straightforward to pick a definition `from the
air' and have it be the right one, an oft overlooked but crucial requirement when models become 
large.
%
%
The next section details the Isabelle proofs of the proof obligations for the above model, 
including:
\begin{itemize}
\item Feasibility proofs for both operations for both levels;
\item Adaquecy proof for the reification;
\item Widen-precondition for both operations;
\item Narrow-postcondition for both operations;
\item Sanity proofs that state that, for example, $\mathit{DISPOSE(NEW) = Id}$.
