TO DO short term
 - complete representation of rtechn
 - evaluation of technique, including matching for features
 - test rewriting
 - fix combinators etc from graph_comb.ML

  List of project things we would like
  Gudmund Grov
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Goals:
 1) be able to draw techniques in a GUI which can be executed
 2) execute techniques as Isabelle methods/tactics (e.g. apply my_technique)
  2a) create Isabelle rippling method/tactic [Yuhui]
 3) develop analogy method in Isabelle
     e.g. apply (analogy: thm1), meaning we apply the proof strategy derived 
     from proof of thm1 to prove current goal. Here, the anti-unification (if
     required) to generalise object level details (such as shape) can combine
     the goal of thm1 with the current open proof state.
     If we have more than one proofs then apply (analogy: thm1 thm2 ...) will 
     find a generalisation of all. Note that in a structure proof this can also
     be used for "local" analogies since each subgoal is named (use this name instead
     of thm)
  4) A GUI combining Isabelle, quanto(graph) and a separate "Isaplanner" window
  5) Data mining for new proof strategies
      use technique in 3 to come up with new strategies (which we may try automatically).
      this will probably be from a different interface[?]
  6) Better integration with NCL
      - learn search strategies (full process is captured there)?
      - use failed branches to check for patterns (e.g. a failed branch in the interactive
        proof may be in the family of another, although the actual end is not) 
      - use of user-provided annotations. e.g. for grouping?

  - make a BNF grammar for features. 

------
Requirements to fulfil goals:
 1) - Quanto needs support for edges 
    - Unless we rely on all methods are just names, we need to add more structure
      to data on vertices + add support for edit them (see 4).
 2) Change goal representation to be closer to Isabelle
 3) FIRST: ignore hypothesis unless explicit fwd proof
   a) parsing of [all required] proofs into graphs
       status: started/intermediate rep currently supported!
   b) automatic feature detection, meaning features on wires
   c) combining "common" edges
   d) combining "common" graphs
   e) discover/replace "patterns"
   f) discover/replace equivalences
   g) generalise two graphs into one (as little OR as possible)
   h) change goal representation to be closer to Isabelle
 4) 
   a) get quanto into eclipse
   b) change the user-interaction
   c) 
 5) a) ability to learn new features (new ILP)    
    b) ability to spot what to generalise (clustering into families) [Katya?]
 6) Decide upon
