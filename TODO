TO DO:

1) graph combinators [easy] -- G started -- see psgraph_comb.ML
    -> should be straightforward for a given graph
    -> try to generalise for all graphs certain operators

2) move socket stuff into isaplib [GG]
    -> still need to be tested and array stuff checked.

3) update rtechn [make it independent of wires] [medium]
     - fix HGraph data [later]
     - complete appfn, ord and eq [medium]

6) rtechn_env -> how can we store such data in proof power? [hard]
     -> is it supported in isaplib?
     -> develop a notion of theory or context independent of isabelle?
     -> we can store this as part of the graph!
     -> maybe we don't need it? (used at least to store map from name to tactic and 
           feature functions, but this could be done statically!)
     -> generalise tactics: make a atomic.ml structure which has to be instantiated
        for each theorem prover!

7) goalnode  [hard]
     -> change to use list of goals in a goal node
     -> need to generalise this indpendent of isabelle 
     -> maybe leave this for now, as it requires eval stuff and proof representation to
        be done first -> e.g. just use a string
     - make Json representation

8) graphs [medium]
   -> we need to support variables in both edge and vertices, so same subst env has to be held
   -> turn a graph into it's json representation
   -> change to use list of goals in goal node as in ITP paper
 

9) eval data [hard]
    -> how much of this can be reused?
    -> can the same thing be used for e.g. proof power (and do we want it too?)

10) make a theory functor [easy]
     -> combines all the above to create a uniform interface

11) instantiate Isabelle for generic [easy]

12) instantiate proof power for generic [easy]

13) link with GUI [easy] [YL to start]

COMPLETED:

1) fix quantomatic/isabelle loading for Isabelle 2013 [easy] [GG]


3) update rtechn [make it independent of wires] [easy]
     - fix typed_rtechn.ML and make morphism to rtechn.ML [YL]
     - complete rtechn_json.ML[YL]

4) goal types -> rename from wires [clear] [GG started]
     -> make it fit with CICM paper [YL & GG]
     -> suggest the following files
        - class.ml -> to hold class properties [YL & GG]
        - link.ml -> to hold link properties [YL & GG]
        - goaltyp.ml -> to hold a goal type [YL & GG]
     - make json representation [YL & GG]

5) generalise goal type with functors [hard] [YL to start]
    -> make a gtrm structure [YL]
    -> functorise goaltyp over this structure (should then be independent of TP system) [YL]
