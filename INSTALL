**** INSTALL *****
-----------------------------------
Downloading and Installing Isabelle
-----------------------------------

Go to 

 http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/isabelle/download.html

and install Isabelle2012

------------------------------------
Downloading and Installing required Libraries 
-----------------------------------

go to the installation directory of Isabelle. On a Mac this is

  cd /Applications/Isabelle-2012.app/Isabelle/

go to the contrib directory:

  cd contrib 

Then get the isaplib library (requires git)

  git clone git://github.com/Quantomatic/isaplib.git

Next, get the quantomatic library (requires git)

  git clone git://github.com/Quantomatic/quantomatic.git
  cd quantomatic
  git checkout scala-frontend
  git pull
 
----------------------------
Downloading and Installing the Proof Strategy language
----------------------------

  git clone https://github.com/ggrov/psgraph.git

**** USAGE *****

- To draw graphs go to the installation directory of Quantomatic (in contrib)
    cd scala
    sbt run
    select the  [3] quanto.gui.GraphEditor option

- To execution a graph (e.g. the intro tactic from ITP'13)
    - got into the psgraph/src/examples/ITP13 directory
    - load the file intro.thy [you need to set the path there]

- Interactive GUI (requires knowledge of Eclipse)    
    - start Eclipse 
    - add the org.ai4fm.psgraph.ui project in the GUI directory of 
      psgraph (the proof strategy language)
    - this requires the zest library which you'll need to install
        http://wiki.eclipse.org/Zest#Zest_2.x
      however, it is more than likely that you'll need the nightly build:
        https://hudson.eclipse.org/hudson/job/gef-zest-nightly/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/targetPlatform/
    - The Ecplipe plug-in includes two views: Graph and PPlan both in the PPlan directory
       when selecting a view
    - Make both fo these visible
    - USING THE GUI
       - When applying the interactive_proof_strategy method in Isabelle a socket
         is set up.
       - To connect to it in the GUI press the `connect to Isabelle' (middle) button in
         the Graph view
       - This will load a Graph -- and the current proof is shows in the PPlan view
       - use the arrows to navigate, and press the (middle) terminate button
         to exit this view
