This folder contains the graph specific part, and talk about
strategies only in terms of wire, goal & rtechn names and their graphs.

For graphical stuff graph_layout.ML can be ignored. 

The visualise subfolder is my attempt to load a visualisation theory, but
doesn't seem to work (may be link with underlying ML level).
